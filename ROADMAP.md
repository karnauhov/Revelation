## Development Plan for Versions 1.x.x (Prologue)

### 1.0.x (Introduction)

#### 1.0.0
+ Write a brief preface about Revelation and the rationale for choosing the list of primary sources.  
+ Create the primary‐sources list screen (7 papyri and 12 majuscules).  
+ Publish to Google Play Store.  

#### 1.0.1
+ Load the primary sources from the server.  
+ Implement a screen for a single primary source where you can select a fragment and view its image.  
+ Implement a screen for download app for different platforms.  
+ Update some primary‐source images, obtain permissions.  
+ Expand the preface with reflections on the principles of studying the Bible by the Bible (reading, understanding, application).  
+ Publish on the Web (GitHub Pages under a custom domain).  
+ Publish to Microsoft Store.  

#### 1.0.2
* Improve the Primary Source screen by adding more image‐editing tools: negative, contrast, brightness, color replacement, black-and-white filter, noise removal, and save changes.  
- Enhance the preface with details on the 7 study stages for each passage (per the rule: reading, understanding, application).  
- Publish on Flathub (Linux).  
- Update some primary‐source images, obtain permissions.  
- Revamp the entire UI in an “ancient manuscript” style using AI: logo, background, colors, fonts, icons, sounds, and music, banners. Study [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder) and [M3 Guidelines](https://m3.material.io).  
- Add background music (loaded from storage) and a toggle in settings to disable it.  

#### 1.0.3
- Add advanced image‐processing tools: color search and outlining, edge highlighting, recognition, and AI-based text detectors.  
- Create a transcription viewer for the fragment on the single‐source screen.  
- Provide transcriptions of this passage from every source that contains it.  
- Complete and document Stage 1 (Formulating the common text from all primary sources for this passage).  
- Add a cookie‐consent banner on the web platform.  
- Publish to Mac App Store (macOS).  
- Publish to App Store (iOS).  

#### 1.0.4
- On hover in the viewing area, highlight each word with a rectangle (and in the transcription).  
- On hover in the transcription area, highlight the corresponding word in the image viewer.  
- In the introduction’s consolidated text, make every word a link that opens a small widget containing a table. For each primary source, the table shows its name, an image of that word in context, its transcription, and a link that opens the source at that exact location and highlights it.  
- On first visit to the web platform, detect the user’s operating system and prompt them to download the corresponding app (Android, Windows, macOS, iOS, Linux).  
- Publish to Amazon Appstore, Huawei AppGallery, and Samsung Galaxy Store.
