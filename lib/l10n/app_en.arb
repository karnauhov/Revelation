  "papyrus_18_features": "On one side of the papyrus, there is a text from the Book of Revelation, and on the other side, the conclusion of the Book of Exodus.

  "papyrus_24_content": "Fragments of Revelation (5:5‚Äì8) and (6:5‚Äì8)",
  "papyrus_24_features": "The papyrus is written on a large sheet approximately 19 √ó 28 cm in size. The text represents the Alexandrian type (or proto-Alexandrian) and aligns with Papyrus 18, Papyrus 47, and the Codex Sinaiticus. Currently, the papyrus is housed in the library of Yale Divinity School.",
  "papyrus_43_title": "Papyrus 43 (ùîì43)",
  "papyrus_43_date": "6th or 7th century AD",
  "papyrus_43_content": "Fragments of Revelation (2:12‚Äì13) and (15:8‚Äì16:2)",
  "papyrus_43_features": "The papyrus was written in two different, careless handwritings, which may indicate its use for selective excerpts rather than continuous text. The text on the reverse side is oriented in the opposite direction to the front side, supporting the assumption of discontinuous content. The text belongs to the Alexandrian type and is classified as Category II according to Kurt Aland's system. Currently, the papyrus is housed in the British Library in London."
