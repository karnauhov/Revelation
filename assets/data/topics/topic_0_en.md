## Why Revelation?

### A Message for Atheists and Non-Christians  
```
If these lines are read by someone who does not believe in God, or if your religion is not Christianity, then do not rush to close the program. Think about it—perhaps you did not end up here by chance. Try reading at least the preface to understand the argumentation. You might also be interested in what God wants to say to people. Consider that in most courts people are given the right to speak before a verdict is announced. Therefore, I suggest reading the preface to the end before rendering your verdict.

The Book of Revelation is a book for all Christians. Jesus Christ himself delivered this message. Right from the first lines, it states from whom it originates, to whom it is addressed, and how it should be properly handled. This program is created to help all Christians, regardless of denomination, understand this book. It may seem difficult. And considering the differences in doctrines, cultures, customs, generations, and even translations of the Bible, it appears almost impossible. In order to overcome all these differences accumulated over 2,000 years, let us try to get as close as possible to the time when the book was written...

> «Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.» (Rev 1:3)
